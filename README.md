# tdf-tracker
Tour de France tracker
Based on the JSON feed from the [Beta Live Tracking](http://letour-livetracking.dimensiondata.com/) from Dimension Data.

# todo
Lots of riders are missing on each update. The RiderTracker should keep track of every rider so if the rider is missing from an update, it doesn't affect the data on screen.

The groups from the live feed aren't very good and can be improved.
